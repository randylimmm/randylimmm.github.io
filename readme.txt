A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
    1. One image of myself to use as a portrait and has a descriptive attribute of where I am.
    2. Included appropriate header and paragraph text in the about section.
    3. Links to external social media pages
    4. Added the use of Font Awesome icons

(b) CSS features
    1. Modified padding and indents on various pages
    2. Modified links and text colors to follow a certain aesthetic.
    3. Used Google fonts to make text and fonts nicer.

(c) Advanced features
    1. Included a video using HTML5 and has a fallback with an image of for the gallery section.
    2. Used animation and key frames within the css to have cool shifting text throughout the website.
    3. I also included a cool shifting background effect where, when users are scrolling the previous image will last for about 50% and swipe gone.
    4. Use of gradients for my background for the line effect.

2. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
    This assignment took me roughly about 13-15 hours, I really enjoyed completing it but it was a struggle to get started and have everything work as I wanted to. I feel like it would have taken less time if I didn't put as much uniqueness as I did and I spent a lot of time watching tutorials to add cool features.

3. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs)

4. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
    I discussed with Nhi Lam about simple stuff with padding and the use of css. Otherwise not much else was discussed.

5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
    No there should not be
